**Requirement Analysis in Software Development.**

This repository outlines the steps involved in the requirement analysis of the Airbnb booking management system clone, emphasizing both the functional and non-functional requirements of the project. The goal of this analysis is to ensure a clear understanding of user needs and system expectations before the design and development phases begin. It also serves as a foundation for building a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly platform that mirrors real-world booking management systems.


**What is Requirement Analysis?**
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the project team identifies, gathers, and defines the needs and expectations of stakeholders for the software system to be developed. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages of development, ensuring that the final product aligns with the user’s goals and business objectives.

During this phase, analysts, developers, and stakeholders collaborate to understand what the system should do and how it should perform. The process involves collecting requirements through techniques like interviews, surveys, brainstorming sessions, and document analysis. These requirements are then analyzed, categorized, and documented clearly for further use in design and development.

Importance of Requirement Analysis

Prevents misunderstandings: It ensures all parties have a shared understanding of the project’s scope and functionality.

Improves quality: Well-defined requirements lead to better system design and implementation.

Saves time and cost: Detecting issues early in the requirement stage helps avoid costly fixes later in development.

Guides development: It provides a roadmap for developers and testers to follow throughout the project lifecycle.

Ensures user satisfaction: By focusing on user needs, the final product is more likely to meet expectations and achieve business goals.

**Why is Requirement Analysis Important?**

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in ensuring the success of any software development project. It helps bridge the communication gap between stakeholders and developers, setting a strong foundation for building a reliable and efficient system. Below are three key reasons why it is critical in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

1. Ensures Clear Understanding of Project Goals

Requirement Analysis helps developers and stakeholders establish a common understanding of the system’s purpose, features, and limitations. By clarifying expectations early, it reduces confusion and ensures everyone is aligned on what the final product should achieve.

2. Reduces Development Costs and Time

Identifying requirements at the start helps detect potential issues, conflicts, or missing features before coding begins. This minimizes the need for rework later in the process, saving both time and resources that could be wasted on fixing preventable errors.

3. Improves System Quality and User Satisfaction

When requirements are well-defined and accurately documented, the development team can design a system that meets user needs more effectively. This leads to a higher-quality product that performs reliably and provides a better user experience.
